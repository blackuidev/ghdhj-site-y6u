The Vercel build error 'npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/motionone' indicates that the 'motionone' package at the specified version could not be found in the npm registry.

This typically means:
1. A typo in the package name in package.json.
2. The package has been deprecated or removed from the registry.
3. A temporary registry issue.

If 'motionone' is a direct dependency in your package.json, consider removing it. Often, 'motionone' is an internal dependency of 'framer-motion'. If you intend to use animation features, ensure 'framer-motion' is correctly installed and updated, which should handle its 'motionone' dependency internally.

To resolve this, please perform the following steps locally:
1. Open your 'package.json' file.
2. Look for 'motionone' in both 'dependencies' and 'devDependencies'.
3. If found, remove the line referencing 'motionone'.
4. Ensure 'framer-motion' (if intended for animations) is listed and up-to-date.
5. Run 'npm install' locally to generate a new 'package-lock.json' file.
6. Commit the changes to your 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json' (if it changed).
7. Redeploy your application on Vercel.

This file is a placeholder to convey this information, as the requested action was a command and not a direct file modification that could be performed without the existing package.json content.
